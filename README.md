## TODO
1. Classify novel hand gesture interaction techniques for moving in a VE (forward, backward, left, right, up, down)
2. For training a model, you need to create a training and validation set. Make a dataset which contains videos of friends/family performing gestures.
3. Feed the videos into the machine for the model to be trained on that dataset.
4. Implement a model and use mediapipe (e.g., CNN and mediapipe) that can detect and classify these hand gestures from hand landmarks (static/dynamic) (e.g., adjusting speed for dynamic hand gestures)
5. Ask friends to do something and see how the model can detect and classify the hand gesture.
6. After finishing the training, you can do parameter comparison or use other model to increase the accuracy.
